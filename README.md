# Linear-Regression-Using-Gradient-Descent
A Linear-Regression Model built from scratch using the gradient descent Algorithm with RMSprop optimization.

# Objective
Train the Linear Regression Model with a Student Performance Dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance) in order to predict the final year grade for a student's math course.

# Graphs
Heat map of the dataset:
